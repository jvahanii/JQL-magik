=== Cloud Scriptrunner, how to fetch Epics of a certain label and all their Stories and Subtasks ===
>> Need two filters
1)
labels in (Theme_InternationalExpansion)  
OR issueFunction in subtasksOf("labels in (Theme_InternationalExpansion)") 
OR issuefunction in issuesInEpics("labels in (Theme_InternationalExpansion)")

2)
filter = Theme_IntlExp_EpicsFeatures OR issuefunction in subtasksOf("filter=Theme_IntlExp_EpicsFeatures")


====================== Swimlanes for Business goals  ==============

issueFunction in issuesInEpics
("
    key=EPICKEY
   
") OR
    (
      issueFunction in subtasksOf("type=Story and issuefunction in issuesInEpics(\"key=EPICKEY\")")
    )
OR key=EPICKEY
OR issuefunction in subtasksOf("key=EPICKEY")

============== many epics on a single swimlane=========
issueFunction in issuesInEpics("
    key in (KOVA-200, KOVA-201, KOVA-202, KOVA-203, KOVA-204)
") OR
    (
      issueFunction in subtasksOf("type=Story and issuefunction in issuesInEpics(\"key in (KOVA-200, KOVA-201, KOVA-202, KOVA-203, KOVA-204)\")")
    )
OR key in (KOVA-200, KOVA-201, KOVA-202, KOVA-203, KOVA-204)
OR issuefunction in subtasksOf("key in (KOVA-200, KOVA-201, KOVA-202, KOVA-203, KOVA-204)")
